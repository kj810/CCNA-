Interfaces and Cables
=====================
- RJ-45 connecters. 랜선. (RJ = Regitered Jack)

###Ethernet
  -Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards.

###Bits and Bytes
  -bits = 0,1
  8bits = 1byte
  (01100101) = 8bits = 1byte
  
  1 kilobit(kb) = 1000 bits
  1 megabit(mb) = 1,000,000 bits
  1 gigabit(gb) - 1,000,000,000 bits
  ...
  
  
 # Ethernet Standard
  - Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
  - IEEE = Institude of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
  
  # UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
    - lower cost than fiber-optic.
    - shorter maximum distance than fiver-opric(~100m).
    - can be vulnerrable to EMI(Electoromagnetic interference).
    - RJ45 ports used with UTP are cheaper than SFP ports.
    - Emit(leak) a faint signal outside of the cable, which can be copied(=security risk)
    
  # Fiber-Optic Cable Standards.
    - Higher cost than UTP
    - Longer Maximum distance than UTP.
    - No vulnerability to EMI.
    - SFP ports are more expecsive than RJ45 ports (single-mode is more expensive than multimode).
